Too rambunctious. Too resistant to convention and authority.\nDespite my troubles, I was still a good kid with a good heart - I just liked to do things my way.\nNow, years later as a man, with the same DNA I had as a kid - my superhero dreams have come true.\nI’m honored to join the iconic #DCUniverse and it’s a true pleasure to become, BLACK ADAM.\nBLACK ADAM is blessed by magic with the powers equal to SUPERMAN, but the difference is he doesn’t toe the mark or walk the line.\nHe’s a rebellious, one of a kind superhero, who’ll always do what’s right for the people - but he does it his way.\nTruth and justice - the BLACK ADAM way.\nThis role is unlike any other I’ve ever played in my career and I’m grateful to the bone we’ll all go on this journey together.\nBLACK ADAM\n12.22.21 ⚡️\nHuge thank you to my friends, @jimlee and @bosslogic for this first time ever bad ass collaboration.", "hashtags": ["DCUniverse"]}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B41AIm7FuGC/", "datetime": "2019-11-14T01:57:30.000Z", "img_urls": ["https://scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/90e5233c80c7c9365a0e2691aa7b4f47/5DD0662F/t51.2885-15/e35/71949222_548769049276478_1052397878941845709_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=1"], "caption": "In 1 month.\nThe Smoldering Doctor returns.\nJUMANJI: The Next Level\nDecember 13th 🌏"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B40dRurFGfI/", "datetime": "2019-11-13T20:56:51.000Z", "img_urls": ["https://scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/569aa1e8cb3bcf8e50f08917223a542c/5DD11594/t51.2885-15/e35/75392904_527318957847966_8254825356446810590_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=1"], "caption": "The countdown begins.\nIN ONE MONTH.\n#JumanjiTheNextLevel\nDECEMBER 13th 🌏", "hashtags": ["JumanjiTheNextLevel"]}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B40Inhvl011/", "datetime": "2019-11-13T17:50:08.000Z", "img_urls": ["https://scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/80b3178b987ff3c1aacbce0f163a7ff2/5E5D7BAA/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/75324996_862489460819646_4296032719968668116_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=1"], "caption": "Warm up - let’s get the blood flowin’ 🩸\nShooting for my next @projectrock collection campaign with @underarmour.\nNew training gear.\nNew technology.\nOld school work ethic.\nA huge THANK YOU to my dream team of shooters 🎥 📸 who work in seamless synchronicity to “get the shots” they need.\nThese guys are rock stars.\nNo bullshitting around when I train so my philosophy is simple when it comes to these photo shoots - I train hard and you shoot it.\nKeep it real.\nNo staged shots.\nNo fake sweat.\nWhen I’m done training - you’re done shooting.\nThis separates our product and brand from the rest.\nTHANK YOU everyone our there for making @projectrock the global leader in training gear and\n@underarmour’s top seller.\nHardest workers in the room.\n#spring2020", "hashtags": ["spring2020"]}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4xLbWtl4Nr/", "datetime": "2019-11-12T14:16:57.000Z", "img_urls": ["https://scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c343ceeed66fbca181105cbad5ef3bd3/5E5D3B6C/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/72469501_733402260479708_6827070128010521912_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=1"], "caption": "Life is noisy.
